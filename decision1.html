    <h1>Brandon's Adventure</h1>
    <p>Brandon decides to follow the mysterious person. He thinks that by following him, he might find some clue about the ruins that he is looking for. He stealthily follows him in order not to be seen, using the trees to hide. After a few hours, Brandon sees the mysterious person stop at a ruined temple.</p>

    <p>The mysterious person enters the temple and disappears into the shadows.</p>
    <p>"Perhaps it is the rumored ruins where the mystical stone is found." Brandon says.
    <p>After that, Brandon enters the temple and sees a large dark place with some broken statues. The statues look human, but in each statue the face was completely destroyed. Brandon continues on his way in search of the stone and finds two doors. The door on the left looks a little burned and the door on the right looks good, but is open.</p>
    <p> What do you want Brandon to do?
