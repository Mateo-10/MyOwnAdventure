    <h1>Brandon's Adventure</h1>
    <p>It is a day like any other. The song of the birds and the leaves of the trees moving with the wind. In a forgotten village, there is a foreigner. His name is Brandon, he is a young and restless adventurer who came to that town due to some rumors about a mystical stone in some ruins near the town. Rumor has it that the stone has the ability to heal any wound, even fatal wounds.</p>

    <p>Brandon begins to ask everyone in the village if they have seen nearby ruins, but unfortunately cannot find any clues as to where the ruins are located. Brandon's stomach starts to growl, so he decides to go get something to eat. He sees a thirty-year-old man selling bread, cooked fish, and water. So, he decides to buy him bread and water. As Brandon eats what he bought, a mysterious person appears and approaches the seller. The person has a black hood, making it difficult to see his face. The mysterious person buys fish and heads to a nearby forest.</p>
    <p>What do you want Brandon to do?
