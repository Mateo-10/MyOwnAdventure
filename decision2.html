    <p>The next day, Brandon returns to the village to buy some food from the same vendor. He buys some food and sits on a nearby big rock to eat. Brandon was losing hope of finding it because he couldn't find any idea where the ruins might be located. 
    <p>Brandon thought. "Maybe the "Mystic Stone" is just a rumor".</p>
    <p>After several minutes, the mysterious person reappears. Brandon thinks that maybe that man knows something about it. After all, he is the only person Brandon has not asked.</p>
    <p>Brandon calls the odd man and asks if he knows anything about ruins and mystical stone.</p>
    <p>"So, you have also come for the rumors, huh?".The mysterious man says.</p>
    <p>"That is an old legend that makes this town popular, but unfortunately it is just a made up story for the elders of this village."</p>
    <p>After that, the mysterious man named William and Brandon had a long talk about the stories of the village. One more incredible than the last.</p>
