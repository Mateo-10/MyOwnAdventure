    <h1>Brandon's Adventure</h1>
    <p>Brandon decides to go to the door on the left. He opens the door and sees the mystical stone. The stone looks like a human face, but its eyes are read. At the same time, Brandon sees burned bodies around the stone.
    <p>"I'm not the only one who came here." Brandon says. Brandon knows that there is a trap, so he picks up a stone from the floor and throws it to see how the trap works. Immediately the rock hits the ground, the flames begin to come out of the walls.</p>
    <p>Brandon threw a lot of rocks to see a place where the flames cannot reach, but the flames were so intense that they could fill almost the entire room. After a few minutes, Brandon sees that the flames gradually diminish in intensity and do not reach the floor. So Brandon takes advantage of that and crawls through the trap to the mystical stone.</p>
    <P>Brandon successfully reaches the mystical stone and takes it. However, once he takes it, the entire temple begin to fall. Brandon puts the stone into his pocket and runs towards his only escape, which is the same path he entered. Brandon crosses the trap again, but the collapse caused the flames to begin to rise again, burning Brandon on his right arm. Successfully, Brandon exited the temple before it completely collapsed. Even though, Brandon injured his right arm, he thinks it wouldn't be a problem because, after all, he now has the Mystic Stone that heals any wound.</P>
    <p>Brandon, hoping the stone will heal his wound, removes the stone from his pocket and places it on his injured arm. Several minutes passed and his arm did not heal.
    <p>"What happen?! Why is it not working?!". Brandon says.
    <p>Brandon due to his anger, throws the stone. The stone rolls until it hits some boots. It was the mysterious man. The mysterious man takes the stone and approaches Brandon without saying anything. The mysterious man grabs Brandon's arm and puts his hands on his arm. Slowly, he heals Brandon's arm. Shocked, Brandon asks the mysterious man how he can do that, but he keeps quiet. After he finishes healing Brandon, he returns the stone to him and says:
    <p>"It only works on full moon".
    <p>After that, the mysterious man leaves the place. Brandon was intrigued by the power of the mystery man and his knowledge about the stone , so Brandon decides to follow him to clear his doubts.</p>
